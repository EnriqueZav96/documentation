Connecting the Windows IoT software to an Odoo database
=======================================================

A *Virtual IoT box* is a computer program that needs to be downloaded and installed on a Windows
computer. This requires a Windows operating system with an Odoo 16 or later database.

The Windows Virtual :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box works the same way as a physical
:abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box, with the ability to run most of the same devices. All
:abbr:`POS (Point of Sale)` devices work with it, such as a scale or printer. Payment terminals will
also work, but it should be noted that :abbr:`MRP (Material Requirement Planning)` devices are not
compatible. *These include cameras or measurement tools.*

Pre-requisites
==============

- Odoo 16 database or any version above
- :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` compatible devices (except those mentioned above)

  .. seealso::
     `Odoo's compatible IoT devices <https://www.odoo.com/app/iot-hardware>`_

- Device drivers for Windows

  .. note::
     Odoo recommends using an updated, recent version of Windows as some older operating systems can
     cause the Windows virtual :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` to not work.

- Windows computer (laptop, desktop, server)
- Odoo IoT subscription

Connect the Windows virtual Iot box to an Odoo database
=======================================================

#. Navigate to the Odoo 16 or higher installation package for Enterprise/Community Windows at
   `Odoo's Download Page <https://odoo.com/download>`_.

#. Install and setup the Odoo :file:`.exe` file.

   After the :guilabel:`Instructions` screen click :guilabel:`Next` to start the installation. Agree
   to the :abbr:`TOS (Terms of Service)`.

#. During the next step of the installation, select :guilabel:`Odoo IoT` from the :guilabel:`Select
   the type of install` dropdown.

   For reference, the following should be installed:

    - **Odoo server**
    - **Odoo IoT**
    - **Nginx WebServer**
    - **Ghostscript interpreter**

   Ensure there is enough space on the computer for the installation and click :guilabel:`Next`.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Destination Folder`.

   .. warning::
      Odoo's Windows virtual IoT software shouldn't be installed inside any of the Window's User's
      directories. Doing so won't allow for Nginx to initialize.

   Choosing `C:\odoo` as the install location will allow for the Nginx server to start. Click
   :guilabel:`Install`. If the folder doesn't exist, then create it. Otherwise the installation
   files will be spread throughout the hard drive.

#. Allow the installation to occur. This may take a few minutes. Click :guilabel:`Next` to continue.

#. Ensure that the :guilabel:`Start Odoo` box is checked and click :guilabel:`Finish`.

#. After installation, the Odoo server will run and automatically open `localhost:8069` on your web
   browser. The webpage should display the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` Box
   :guilabel:`Configuration` page.

   .. seealso::
      A restart of the Windows :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` program may be necessary should the
      web browser not display anything. :ref:`productivity/restart_windows_iot`

#. Connect :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` devices to the Windows computer.

#. Windows should automatically detect the device because the driver is pre-installed on the
   computer. If not, search for and install the Windows driver for the device.

#. Refresh the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` Box :guilabel:`Configuration` page and verify the
   device is seen on the :guilabel:`Configuration` page. If not, reload the handlers through the
   :guilabel:`Configuration` page.

#. Connect Windows :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` to a database using existing instructions
   (manually using the Token).

   .. seealso::
      :doc:`/applications/productivity/iot/config/connect`

#. Use the devices connected to :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` as you normally would.

Troubleshooting
===============

.. _productivity/restart_windows_iot:

Restart Windows IOT box
-----------------------

In some instances a manual restart of the physical :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box can resolve
the issue of an :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box not showing up on the database. For the Windows
virtual :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box a manual restart of the Odoo server can resolve
database connection issues.

To restart the virtual Windows IoT server:

#. Type `Services` into the :guilabel:`Search Bar`
#. Select the :menuselection:`Services` App and scroll down to the :guilabel:`Odoo` Service.
#. Right click on :guilabel:`Odoo` and select :guilabel:`Start` or :guilabel:`Restart`. This action
   will manually restart the Odoo IoT server.

Firewalls
---------

The Windows virtual :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box software may not be reachable to the
:abbr:`LAN (Local Area Network)` due to a firewall preventing the connection. Consult your local IT
support to make exceptions (network discovery) in the :abbr:`OS (Operating System)` or firewall
program. Windows has their own firewall as well as other virus protection do too.

.. example::
   A client might encounter a time when they are able to reach the homepage of the :abbr:`IoT
   (Internet of Things)` box, yet they cannot access it from another computer/mobile/tablet on the
   same network.

Uninstalling Windows IoT
------------------------

Uninstalling the Windows virtual :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box is done through the Windows
program manager. Search in any Windows version for `program`. Select :menuselection:`Add or Remove
Programs` located in the :guilabel:`Control Panel`. Search for `Odoo` and click the :guilabel:`â‹®
(three dot menu)` to uninstall.

Confirm the un-installation and follow the steps to uninstall through the Odoo uninstall guide.

Articles management
===================

Managing articles effectively is key to maximizing the value of your knowledge resources, whether
working on a research project, studying for an exam, or building a knowledge database for your
business. Knowledge allows you to fully manage your articles, from
:ref:`creation <management/create>` to :ref:`removal <management/delete>`, through
:ref:`structuration <management/structure>` and :ref:`sharing with others <management/share>`.

You can find most tools to manage articles by clicking the vertical ellipsis button (:guilabel:`⋮`)
at the right side of the top bar. From there, you can move, lock, delete, or make a copy of an
article.

.. _management/create:

Create articles
===============

To create articles, click the :guilabel:`+ New` button on the right side of the top bar or the
:guilabel:`+` button next to a category or another article.

.. tip::
   Shortcut the creation of private articles; press **alt** and **c** simultaneously on your
   keyboard.

.. _management/structure:

Structure articles
==================

Hierarchy
---------

Articles are organized into a hierarchical structure wherein the article on top is a parent article,
and those underneath are called nested articles. This structure allows the grouping of related
articles.

To establish this hierarchy, create new articles by clicking the :guilabel:`+` button next to the
parent-to-be article, or move existing articles by either dragging and dropping them under the
parent-to-be or by clicking the vertical ellipsis button (:guilabel:`⋮`), clicking :guilabel:`Move
To` on the toolbox and selecting the article to use as a parent.

.. note::
   The number of nested articles is **not** limited.

Categories
----------

Additionally, they are divided into four categories that can be found on the left sidebar. These
categories give articles default access rights and permissions.

- :guilabel:`Favorites`: You can set any article you can access as a favorite. To do so, click the
  star-shaped icon on the menu at the top-right of the articles. Doing so is user-specific and has
  no impact on other users.
- :guilabel:`Workspace`: Articles displayed in that category are available to all internal users.
  These users have the right to read, modify or share these articles.
- :guilabel:`Shared`: Articles displayed in that category are those you shared with internal or
  external users or shared with you.
- :guilabel:`Private`: Articles displayed in that category are only available to you.

.. _management/share:

Share articles
==============

You can share articles with other users or external users. To do so, open the share menu by clicking
:guilabel:`Share` on the menu at the top-right of articles.

To share one online, activate the :guilabel:`Share to web` button. Doing so generates an URL link
for any person to view the article.

To share one with specific users (internal to your company or external, such as a partner or a
customer), click :guilabel:`Invite`. Doing so opens a pop-up window on which you can choose the
:guilabel:`Permission` to grant and enter the :guilabel:`Recipients`' name or email.

From that window, you can also restrict a specific user from accessing the article by granting them
:guilabel:`No access` permission.

.. note::
   External users are never allowed to edit an article.

Additionally, the share menu displays the default permission for internal members along with all the
users who have been granted specific permission.

.. _management/delete:

Delete articles
===============

To remove an article, you can either delete it or archive it.

To delete an article, click the vertical ellipsis button :menuselection:`(⋮) --> Delete`. The
article is moved to the trash for 30 days before being permanently removed. To reinstate it, click
:guilabel:`Open the Trash`, select the article, and click :guilabel:`Restore`.

To archive an article, click :guilabel:`Search`, select the article(s), and click
:menuselection:`Action --> Archive --> Archive`. Archived articles are hidden from the search menu.
To retrieve an archived article, add a custom filter to display archived articles
(:menuselection:`Filters --> Add Custom Filter`, and set :guilabel:`Active` as :guilabel:`is No`).
Then, select the article and go to :menuselection:`Action --> Unarchive`.
